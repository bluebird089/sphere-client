### Five features of my project

- My web page is built with React Router DOM. That is why it is possible to navigate multiple routes on a single page on my website without any reload.

- I used the Tailwind CSS framework instead of vanilla CSS for my web pages, which allowed me to do all my design-related tasks without any problems. As a result I have been able to give many attractive designs to my web page. And  I have made my website responsive for all types of devices, so my website will look good on all devices.

- My website is Event Management Services. We provide all these services for corporate events. My website has various types of services related to corporate events such as, 1 : Conference and Seminars. 2: trade shows. 3: team building workshops. 4 : Product launches. 5: corporate meetings. 6: Award ceremonies.

- To know the complete information of all the services of my website, a user must login.

- To get access to private routes on my website you must login so I have three options for login firstly login with password and email. And there is an option to login with google account. And login with GitHub.
